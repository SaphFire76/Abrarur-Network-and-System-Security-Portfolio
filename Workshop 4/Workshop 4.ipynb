    "# Section 3: Signature-Based Malware Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphic and Metamorphic Viruses\n",
    "\n",
    "Metamorphic and polymorphic malware are two types of malware that can change their code as they propagate through a system. The main difference between them is that polymorphic malware can morph itself to change its code using a variable encryption key, whereas metamorphic malware rewrites its code without an encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphic malware uses an encryption key to change its shape and signature. Polymorphic malware consists of two parts, namely:\n",
    "1. Encrypted virus body. Code that changes its shape.\n",
    "2. Virus decryption routine. Code that doesn't change its shape and decrypts and encrypts the other part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metamorphic malware is rewritten with each iteration without using an encryption key. Malware authors use multiple transformation tehniques to do this, such as:\n",
    "- register renaming\n",
    "- code permutation\n",
    "- code expansion\n",
    "- code shrinking\n",
    "- garbage code insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "For both, polymorphic and metamorphic viruses, the changing code make traditional signature-based virus detection methods redundant. Even if the virus is detected and placed on a blocklist, the virus will soon have transformed, making it untraceable once again. Polymorphic viruses have a static code for its virus decryption routine, this makes it more susceptible to detection than metamorphic viruses. (https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/metamorphic-and-polymorphic-malware#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20them,code%20without%20an%20encryption%20key.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of effectively detecting the above malware is by using signature-less malware detection, such as ML algorithms, to analyse the broader picture and extract 'features' fromt he files analysed. For example, the ML model can look at the randomness in various areas of the file. (https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-gb/cybersecurity-101/malware/polymorphic-virus/)\n",

    "#### 1. How does the infection curve change if you double the number of attempts per host?\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubling the number of attemps per host will steepen the curve. This is because the worm spreads at a faster speed, as more scans mean greater change of the worm successfully infecting a host. The curve will level off at the same point as the number of hosts remains 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why might a worm choose a local subnet propagation strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "A local subnet strategy means the worm will first infect hosts on the same local subnet (hosts with the same network prefix). This allows the worm to spread quickly due to low latency and high speeds. By using this strategy, worms can also often bypass security such as firewalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Which containment strategy (rate limiting, scan detection, thresholding) would be most effective here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scan detection is the is most effective against worms. It works by looking for two specific patterns: port scanning and IP sweeping. Port scanning is when one device is checking many different ports on a single target. IP sweeping is when one device is checking the same port on many different computers. It can then quarintine the the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting also works against worms. It controls the volume of traffic allowed to pass through the network. This slows down the spread of the worm from exponential rate to an almost linear one. (https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding is the mechanism used to configure the strategies above. It works by setting numerical limits, for example, \"Alert if > 100 connections per second\". This is a static strategy and is dependent on how well the limits are tuned. It can often result in false positives."

    "#### 1. Which layer of defence failed first in most real-world malware outbreaks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Human layer or patch management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing is often used as a gateway for attacks. This is because humans make mistakes. Humans are often far from objective, and even with ample training, external factors may affect their judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A failure to regularly update security systems is also often a primary point of failure. For example, the WannaCry ransomware worm used the EternalBlue exploit to propagate. Microsoft had already released patches close the eploit before the attack started, but many organisations failed update their Windows systems. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can AI-based systems be trained to detect abnormal patterns safely?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI runs on a clean network first to learn what \"normal\" looks like. Engineers then create synthetic data that mimics the behavior of malware (like rapid scanning) without the destructive payload. This allows the AI to practice spotting anomalies without putting real data at risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. How should security teams balance detection sensitivity and false positives?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a detection system is too sensitive it will raise false alerts/positives. This may cause 'alert fatigue' in the analysts making them lax. They might miss the real attack in between the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if a system only alerts for 100% known malware, it will miss zero-day attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this teams often use contextual scoring, which means instead of just alerting yes or no, the system returns a risk score that tells the analysts the likelihood that the connection is a malware."
